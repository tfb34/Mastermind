# Mastermind

Objective:
The player has at most 12 chances to guess a secret combination of 4 colors generated by the computer.


HOW TO PLAY
  To create your guess you may select any of the following colors:
         blue,green,red, orange,yellow, purple
  Duplicates are allowed. 
  Each time you submit a guess, the machine will tell you how close that guess 
  is by returning a black and white score.
  
  A black score of 2 indicates that two of the values in your guess are
  the correct color in the right position.
  A white score of 1 indicates that one of the values in your guess
  is the correct color in the wrong position.

  Use these scores to guide your next guess. If your guess returns a black
  score of 4 within 12 tries, you win!
  
 SETUP
   Open your terminal and change the directory to the folder in which the game resides.
